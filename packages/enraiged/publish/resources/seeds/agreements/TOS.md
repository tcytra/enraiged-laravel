Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&C)
are the legal agreements between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service. The person must agree to
abide by the terms of service in order to use the offered service. Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer,
especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy sentences used in the terms of use have brought
concerns on customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.

The Terms of Service Agreement is mainly used for legal purposes by companies which provide software or services, such
as web browsers, e-commerce, web search engines, social media, and transport services. 

A legitimate terms-of-service agreement is legally binding and may be subject to change. Companies can enforce the terms
by refusing service. Customers can enforce by filing a lawsuit or arbitration case if they can show they were actually
harmed by a breach of the terms. There is a heightened risk of data going astray during corporate changes, including
mergers, divestitures, buyouts, downsizing, etc., when data can be transferred improperly.
