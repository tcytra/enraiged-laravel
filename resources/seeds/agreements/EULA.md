An end-user license agreement (E.U.L.A.) is a legal contract entered into between a software developer or vendor and the
user of the software, often where the software has been purchased by the user from an intermediary such as a retailer. A
EULA specifies in detail the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of the software.

End-user license agreements are usually lengthy, and written in highly specific legal language, making it difficult for
the average user to give informed consent. If the company designs the end-user license agreement in a way that
intentionally discourages users from reading them, and uses difficult to understand language, many of the users may not
be giving informed consent.

Click-wrap license agreements refer to website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service
Level Corp.). A common example of this occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by
clicking "yes" on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses,
where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing
the software itself. In both types of analysis, focus is on the actions of end user and asks whether there is an
explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.
